# React JS Landing Page Template

**

# 🛎️🛎️ Good news! New & improved [V2](https://github.com/issaafalkattan/react-landing-page-template-2021) is out  

**


### <a href="https://react-landing-page-template.herokuapp.com">LIVE DEMO</a> 

## Description
This is a ReactJS based landing page template, fit for a startup company/service with a one page view. The design is inspired by a template from <a href="https://www.free-css.com/assets/files/free-css-templates/preview/page234/interact/">Free-CSS.com </a>
All 'visual' data can be easily modified by changing the data.json file.

## Make it Yours!
### 1. Prerequisites
Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> 20.x.

### 2. Install and run locally
After cloning the files, install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can also use Yarn if you prefer:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

### 3. Add your own data
Change the data in `public/data/data.json` and add images to `public/img/`.

## npm deprecation warnings
If you see warnings such as `rimraf@2`, `babel-eslint`, or `core-js@2` during install, those typically come from an old lockfile or a previously installed dependency tree.

This repo currently uses a modern Vite + React dependency set in `package.json`, so the cleanest fix is to remove stale install artifacts and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json yarn.lock
npm install
```

Warnings by themselves do **not** always mean your build is broken, but reinstalling from a clean state usually removes outdated transitive packages.
